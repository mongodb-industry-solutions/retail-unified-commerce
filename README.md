# Store Associate App Demo ‚Äì From Data Silos to Smart Service with MongoDB Atlas

This README helps developers understand the purpose, structure, and deployment process of this unified commerce demo.

---

## Overview

This demo showcases a store associate application built on **MongoDB Atlas**, designed to streamline **product discovery** and **inventory visibility** as part of a **unified commerce strategy**.

Unified commerce connects all sales channels, data, and backend systems into a single, real-time platform‚Äîdelivering a complete view of the business and enabling consistent, personalized customer experiences.

![Unified Commerce](docs/images/unified_commerce.png)

Powered by MongoDB‚Äôs flexible document model, the app unifies product and inventory data into one operational layer. From classic search to semantic and hybrid search‚Äîincluding geospatial queries to check nearby store availability‚Äîthis experience demonstrates how unified commerce becomes actionable by giving store associates accurate data to serve with speed, clarity, and confidence.

## üéØ Demo Goals & Capabilities

- **Demonstrate how MongoDB Atlas enables unified, real-time operational data through flexible modeling.**
  - The document model allows you to organize data for efficient performance and retrieval. This demo showcases one example: a `products` collection with an embedded `inventorySummary` that keeps product and inventory data connected‚Äîenabling high-performance retrieval and continuous real-time updates using **Atlas Triggers**.


- üîçüß† **Showcase advanced, intelligent product discovery with MongoDB Atlas:**
  - Regular search (regex) : Basic pattern matching used as a baseline to compare against MongoDB‚Äôs advanced search features.
  - Full-text search (Atlas Search): Relevance-based search using $search with fuzzy matching, field boosts, pagination, and store-level filtering.
  - Semantic vector search (via Voyage AI embeddings)
  - Hybrid search (RRF fusion of text and vector results)
  - Geospatial queries to find nearby availability
  - Comming soon...Boost promotions to align with sales goals / Image-based product search using multimodal embeddings

- üèóÔ∏è **Use clean architecture to structure the advanced search microservice**
  - This demo implements advanced search logic in a dedicated microservice using a modular, layered architecture. It separates the API layer, use-case logic, and infrastructure concerns. Key benefits include:
      - **Swappable AI providers:** Easily integrate or replace embedding providers (e.g., switching from Voyage AI to Bedrock, or an internal vector service) by isolating vector generation behind an interface.
      - **Extensible search logic:** Add new retrieval strategies or post-processing steps, such as rule-based re-rankers, personalization layers, or business-logic filters‚Äîwithout touching core orchestration code
      - **Multi-channel reuse:** Expose the same unified search logic through different entry points like REST, GraphQL, or event-based consumers‚Äîenabling consistent behavior across web apps, mobile, or conversational agents

## üß© Architecture Overview

![Architecture Overview](docs/images/architecture_overview.png)

| Component | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Frontend (Next.js)** | Mini-monolith app that handles UI and basic MongoDB queries. Manages geospatial logic locally (finding stores with stock nearby) and delegates advanced product search to the microservice. |
| **Advanced Search Microservice (Python)** | Cleanly architected FastAPI service that performs 4 types of search and coordinates query embeddings with Voyage AI. |
| **MongoDB Atlas** | Core operational data layer with 3 collections: `products`, `inventory`, and `stores`. Stores text and image embeddings used for semantic and image-based search.‚Ä¢ Each product embeds a store-level inventorySummary. One Atlas Trigger listens for key inventory changes and syncs product documents. A second scheduled trigger simulates daily inventory updates to maintain realism and consistency. |
| **Embeddings & AI Integration** | Embeddings were generated using **Voyage AI** and stored in MongoDB. The same model is used for query embedding generation to ensure consistency. The architecture also supports swapping in alternative providers. |

üëâ For technical deep dives, see the [Frontend README](./frontend/README.md) and [Advanced Search Microservice README](./backend/advanced-search-ms/README.md).

## üê≥ Getting Started ‚Äì Run the Full Demo Locally

### üîß Prerequisites

- [MongoDB Atlas account](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register) (Free Tier works)
- [Demo dataset](./docs/setup/collections/README.md/) - we provide JSON files for the 3 required collections:
  - [products collection with embeddings](./docs/setup/collections/retail-unified-commerce.products.json/)
  - [inventory collection](./docs/setup/collections/retail-unified-commerce.inventory.json/)
  - [stores collection](./docs/setup/collections/retail-unified-commerce.stores.json/)
- [Index definitions](./docs/setup/indexes/README.md/) in:
  - [search index](./docs/setup/indexes/search-index.json/)
  - [vector index](./docs/setup/indexes/vector-index.json/)
- [Atlas Triggers](./docs/setup/atlas-triggers/README.md/) ‚Äì Not required to run the app, but we include two triggers to keep inventory data fresh and simulate real-world updates:
  - [daily inventory simulation](./docs/setup/atlas-triggers/daily_inventory_simulation.js/)
  - [inventory sync](./docs/setup/atlas-triggers/inventory_sync.js/)
- Environment configuration files (.env) for each app, using .env.example files as a template:
  - [frontend](./frontend/.env.example)
  - [advanced-search-ms](./backend/advanced-search-ms/.env.example)
- Installed tools:
  - Docker + Docker Compose

## üçÉ  Why MongoDB for Unified Commerce

MongoDB Atlas is a powerful **Operational Data Layer (ODL)** for unified commerce. It simplifies how retailers consolidate, serve, and act on critical data across channels.

![MongoDB Atlas](docs/images/mongodb_atlas.png)

### Key Advantages

- **Flexible document model**  
   Easily model rich, complex retail data‚Äîsuch as products with per-store inventory, pricing, or media assets‚Äîin a single document. No rigid schemas or painful joins.

- **Built-in advanced search**  
   With Atlas Search and Vector Search, retailers can implement full-text, semantic, hybrid, and even image-based product discovery directly on operational data‚Äîwithout needing separate search or vector databases.

- **Support for modern AI-driven apps**  
  Store and query multimodal embeddings, trigger real-time updates, and support smart recommendations with minimal complexity. Atlas is built to support AI-native experiences with operational-grade performance.

- **Simplified architecture**  
  Reduce ETL complexity, avoid data duplication, and enable real-time updates with features like Atlas Triggers, Change Streams, and Online Archive. Run analytics or AI workloads on dedicated nodes without affecting core performance.

- **üåü What‚Äôs Next: Native AI Simplicity**  
 MongoDB will soon offer native support for automatic embedding generation and reranking‚Äîmaking intelligent search and recommendations even easier to build.
